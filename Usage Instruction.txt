For hardcoded inputs:

This is function is built-in for effective memory writing without having to manupulate components and effectiveness.

This functionality is implemented for register files and memory as they are hard to overwrite.

Note that this functionality is to be used when the processor isnt at any stage or it will abnormally manupulate some values in Memory and Rf
For usage of this functionality it is advised to always turn on EN-HARDCODE.

After doing that move to the hardcode section.
Enable the EN-HARDCODE.

After this, either we change memory or register files-

1) Enter the memory or register file address
2) Enter the values desired.
3) Then trigger memory or register triggers respectively for your choice of operation.
4) Turn off the enable.
